The Currency Converter allows users to convert amounts between different currencies using predefined exchange rates. In this implementation, we include USD, EUR, JPY, GBP, AUD, and INR. Users will input the amount they wish to convert, specify the currency they're converting from, and the currency they're converting to. The program then calculates and displays the converted amount.
